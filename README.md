## Environment Setup

### Install Dexon Google Extension
1. go to google extension and search for DeKuSan
2. install it and create DeKuSan account just like MetaMask
3. remember your passphrases for later contracts deployment

### Install npm Packages
1. go to `root/smart-contracts` directory
2. type `yarn install` to install required dependencies (dexon-truffle)
3. go to `root/reactui` directory
4. type `yarn install` to install required dependencies (web3, material UI, etc)

## Smart Contracts Setup

### Contracts Deployment
1. initiate local host ganache
```
$ ganache-cli -m "your passphrases"
```

2. go to `root/smart-contracts` directory
3. cp `secret.js.example` to `secret.js` and change the `mnemonic` to your **DeKuSan wallet passphrases**
4. compile the contracts codes, and you'll get contract abi in `root/smart-contracts/build/contracts/CPlatform.json` file
```
$ npm run compile
```

5. migrate our contract on your **ganache localhost:8545**
```
$ npm run test
```
6. remember your contract address

### React Setup
1. go to `root/react-ui/src` directory
2. open `App.js`
3. go to code `line 2` and change contract address to the address you remember in previous step
4. open `root/smart-contracts/build/contracts/CPlatform.json` and find abi section
5. replace the line after `export default` with your abi code 

now your react-ui can interact with your smart contracts
